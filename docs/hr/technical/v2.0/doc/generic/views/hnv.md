from twixio_views.generic.cbv.views import TwixioNavView
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

class EmployeeNavView(TwixioNavView):
    """
    EmployeeNavView
    """

    nav_title = "Employees"
    search_url = reverse_lazy("employee-tab-view") 
    #path to your view where search/filter submited
    search_swap_target = "#tabContainer" # cbv-employee-list view's view_id
```

## View Types
View types is the attribute for the `hnv` that helps to include multiple views in the navbar. Using the feature can be configured the views like list, card or any other views instead of `htv`.
```python
view_types = [
    {
        "type": "list",
        "icon": "list-outline", # ionicons icon name
        "url": reverse_lazy("hlv"), # path/url to the view
    },
    {
        "type": "card",
        "icon": "grid-outline", # ionicons icon name
        "url": reverse_lazy("hcv"), # path/url to the view
    },
]

```

## Group By Fields
HNV provides dropdown to select the group by fields for the list views. Using the `group_by_fields` all the fields are listed in a drop down feature in the nav view. Supported related field grouping.

```python
group_by_fields = [
    ...
    ("employee_work_info__department_id", "Department"),
    ...
]
```

## Actions
Actions is `HNV` is also a drop down that indicates or list out all the bulk actions. You can add the attributes in the `attr` that complete or support the action.

```python
actions = [
    {
        "action": "Import",
        # "attrs": "", # attrs to support the action
        # "accessibility": "", # accessibility method mapping
    },
    {
        "action": "Export",
        # "attrs": "", # attrs to support the action
        # "accessibility": "", # accessibility method mapping
    },
    
]
```

## Filter Body Template
The `filter_body_template` is the template for the filter form. The form `filter_form_context_name` option is used to mention the form context name that is used in the `filter_body_template`.

```python
filter_body_template = "employee_filters.html"
filter_form_context_name = "filter_form"
```
The custom filter body template
```html
<!-- templates/employee_filters.html -->
{{filter_form}}
```
