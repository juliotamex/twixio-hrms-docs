## Notes

- By default, the demo database will be loaded, which includes an admin user with the following credentials:
  - **Username**: `admin`
  - **Password**: `admin`
  
- If you want to start with a fresh database, you can modify the database settings in the `twixio/settings.py` file. Change the database name as per your requirement.

In the `DATABASES` section of the `settings.py` file, you will find:
```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "TestDB_Twixio.sqlite3",
    }
}
```
Change the `NAME` field to your desired SQLite database name (ensure the file format is `.sqlite3`).

- To run the server after making changes, use the following command:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
