# **Whatsapp Documentation**

This documentation describes how to integrate whatsapp to twixio. By integrating whatsapp into twixio employees can get notifications from twixio to their whatsapp number, and employees can create requests from whatsapp without leaving the app using whatsapp flows.

## **Before You Start** 

You will need:

* **A Meta developer account** — [learn more about registering as a Meta developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register).

We are using version v21.0 of the graph API and version 5.0 of the flow in whatsapp.

## **Create an App in Meta**

Log on to your meta developer account and,

*  click on the “**create app**” button on the top right side.![alt text](media/image.png)

## **Setting webhook**

In the meta app page, go to the configuration  
![alt text](media/image-12.png)

You want to set the callback URL and token in the form.

* Callback URL: The callback URL is the webhook URL to which the meta sends the details of messages when a user sends the message to the company's phone number.  
  * **Callback URL**: **{YOUR\_IP\_ADDRESS}/whatsapp/**  (needs https connection)  
* Verify token: This token is to verify the webhook connection to the server. The connection will be successful only if this token matches the token from the server  
  * **Verify token**: The token set in the **whatsapp credentials page in Twixio settings**.

Then click on the verify and save button. If the connection is successful, the page refreshes to show the webhook fields.

From the webhook fields, make sure that “**Flows**” and “**Messages**” are subscribed.

After connecting the webhook, return back to the twixio settings and click on the send test message button.  
If all the details provided are correct when you click on the send test message and give a phone number with country code, then a message, “This is a test message”, will be sent to that number (only if you have added the company phone number in whatsapp and meta approved it and you have added your payment method to meta).

## **Creating Message Templates and Flows**

After testing the sample message, click on the “create template and flows” button under the options column and wait for some time. This button creates the necessary message templates and flows to the whatsapp number in the background. Wait for it to create.

After all these steps you are ready and successfully connected to the whatapp.
