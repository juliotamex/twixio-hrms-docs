## **3\. Best Practices**

1. Configure at least one mail server before attempting to receive emails into the CRM.  
2. Designate one configuration as the Primary Mail Server for default email receiving operations.  
3. For Outlook configurations, ensure proper Azure AD app registration and permissions (specifically Mail.Read and Mail.ReadWrite permissions) are set up beforehand.  
4. For other mail servers using Gmail or similar providers:  
   * Use app-specific passwords rather than regular account passwords for enhanced security  
   * Enable IMAP access in your email provider's settings  
   * For Gmail, use `imap.gmail.com` as the host and port `993`  
5. Verify that firewall and security settings allow incoming connections on the specified IMAP ports.  
6. Maintain secure storage of client secrets and passwords; use the visibility toggle only when necessary.  
7. Regularly refresh OAuth tokens for Outlook configurations to ensure continued functionality.  
8. Review and update mail configurations periodically to ensure continued functionality and security compliance.
