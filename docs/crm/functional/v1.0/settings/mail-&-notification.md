###  **Form Fields**

* Module – The CRM module this rule applies to (e.g., Lead, Contact, Department, Opportunity).  
* Mail to/Notify to – The user field(s) on the record that will receive the notification (e.g., Created By, Assigned To).  
* Also Send to – Additional recipients to be copied on the notification outside of the record's user fields.  
* Trigger – Defines when the rule fires. The available options are:  
  * On Create – Fires when a new record is created in the selected module.  
  * On Update – Fires when an existing record is edited and saved.  
  * On Create and Update – Fires on both record creation and any subsequent update.  
  * On Delete – Fires when a record is permanently deleted from the selected module.  
  * Scheduled (time-based) – Fires automatically at a configured time relative to a date field on the record.  
* Target Date Field – Available only for Scheduled trigger. The date field on the record used as the reference point for the schedule (e.g., Follow Up Date, Due Date).  
* Adjust By – Available only for Scheduled trigger. A numeric offset applied before or after the Target Date Field (e.g., \-2 for 2 days before, 3 for 3 days after).  
* Timing – Available only for Scheduled trigger. The direction of the offset: Before or After the target date.  
* Offset Unit – Available only for Scheduled trigger. The time unit for the Adjust By value: Days, Hours, Weeks, or Months.  
* Run Time – Available only for Scheduled trigger. The specific time of day (HH:MM) at which the scheduled notification will be sent.  
* Choose Delivery Channel – How the notification is delivered. Options are:  
  * Send as Mail – Sends a formatted email using the selected Mail Template and Outgoing Mail Server.  
  * Send as Notification – Delivers an in-app notification within Twixio CRM. Requires a Notification Template.  
  * Send as Mail and Notification – Sends both an email and an in-app notification at the same time.  
* Mail Template – The pre-configured email template used for the notification body. Required when sending as Mail.  
* Notification Template – The template used for the in-app notification. Required when sending as Notification or Mail and Notification.  
* Outgoing Mail Server – The configured mail server used to dispatch the email. Required when sending as Mail.  
* Condition – Optional filter logic to restrict when the rule fires. Conditions are built using:  
  * Select Field – The record field to evaluate (e.g., Status, Priority, Stage).  
  * Select Operator – The comparison to apply: equals, not equals, contains, is empty, greater than, etc.  
  * Enter Value – The value to compare against (e.g., High, Closed Won).  
  * Select Logical Operator – Combine multiple conditions using AND or OR.  
  * Click \+ Add More to add additional condition rows. If no conditions are set, the rule fires for every matching trigger event.

### **2.3 Managing Existing Rules**

Purpose: Provide management options for configured notification rules.

* Edit icon – Opens the rule form pre-populated with current settings for modification.

* Delete icon – Permanently removes the notification rule.

* Enable/Disable toggle – Activates or deactivates a rule without deleting it. Inactive rules will not fire even if their trigger conditions are met.

## **3\. Best Practices**

* Use descriptive rule titles that include the module, trigger, and recipient (e.g., Lead \- On Create \- Notify Sales Manager).

* Always configure and verify Mail Templates and Outgoing Mail Servers before activating rules.

* Use Conditions to avoid notification overload — send alerts only for genuinely actionable events.

* For Scheduled triggers, ensure the Target Date Field is consistently populated on all records in the selected module.

* For On Delete rules, test in a staging environment before enabling in production.

* When using Send as Mail and Notification, ensure both the Mail Template and Notification Template are configured and up to date.

* Regularly review active rules and disable or delete any that are no longer relevant.
