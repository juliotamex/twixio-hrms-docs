# **Complete Guide to Cadences – Twixio CRM**

## **Overview**

Cadences define automated, multi-stage outreach workflows for CRM records. A cadence triggers a sequence of tasks, calls, and emails based on configured conditions.

Each stage progresses automatically when the previous stage’s activity reaches a defined status. Cadences support branching, allowing different follow-up actions based on different outcomes.

Cadences can be applied to:

* Lead  
* Contact  
* Account  
* Opportunity

## **Branching Workflows**

From Follow up 2 onwards, cadences support branching.

Multiple follow-ups can be created from one parent based on different statuses.


### **Example**

Follow up 1 → Task

* Completed → Follow up 2 (Email)  
* Overdue → Follow up 2 (Call)

Only the matching branch is executed.

## **Adding Follow-Ups**

* **\+ (right side)** → Add next stage  
* **\+ (below)** → Add same stage (FU3+)

**Note:**  
 A follow-up cannot be deleted if it has child branches.

## **Cadence Execution**

### **Record Enrollment**

When a record is created or updated:

* Active cadences are evaluated  
* Matching records trigger Follow up 1

### **Stage Progression**

When an activity status changes:

* Next-stage follow-ups are triggered  
* Only matching branch is executed

### **Backfill**

* On activation → Follow up 1 is applied to existing records  
* On update → Pending activities are synced

## **Cadence Reports**
