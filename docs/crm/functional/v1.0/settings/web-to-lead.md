# **Web to Lead — Functional Guide**

## **How Lead Capture Works**

When a visitor submits the form:

* A new Lead is created in Twixio CRM  
* Lead Source → automatically set to **Website**  
* Lead Status → set to the first active pipeline stage  
* Lead Owner → assigned based on form settings  
* User sees success message or gets redirected

## **Additional Recommendations**

* Keep the form simple; too many fields can reduce submissions  
* Use clear labels and required fields only when necessary  
* Match form design (colors, wording) with your website branding  
* Test the form after embedding to ensure proper lead creation  
* Regularly review captured leads to maintain data quality
