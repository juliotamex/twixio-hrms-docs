# **Export Data - Functional Guide**

## **Introduction**

The Twixio CRM Export Data feature, found under the Data Management section, allows users to efficiently extract and download data from various CRM modules. This functionality supports both immediate exports and automated scheduled exports, enabling businesses to generate reports, perform data analysis, or integrate information with external tools.

Exports are available in formats such as Excel, CSV, or PDF, providing flexibility for different use cases. The module integrates seamlessly with core CRM sections like Base, Mail, Leads, Opportunities, and Forecast, ensuring comprehensive data portability while maintaining data integrity and security.
