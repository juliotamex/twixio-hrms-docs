# **Scoring Rules – Complete Functional Guide**

## **Introduction**

The **Scoring Rules** module in Twixio CRM allows organizations to assign weighted points to records in **Leads** and **Opportunities**. By applying rule-based criteria, CRM users can prioritize high-quality leads and focus on opportunities most likely to close.
