## **Opportunity Teams & Splits: Functional Guide**

### **Introduction**

The **Opportunity Teams** and **Opportunity Splits** features in Twixio CRM enable structured team collaboration and revenue attribution on individual opportunities. Team Selling must be enabled before either feature is accessible. Once enabled, users can assign team members to opportunities with defined roles and access levels, and optionally split revenue or quantity credit across those members using configurable split types.

1. ### **Enable Team Selling**

**Path:** Settings → Opportunity → Opportunity Team Settings

Team Selling is disabled by default. Navigate to the path above and click **Enable Team Selling** to activate the feature for your company. Once enabled, the Opportunity Teams list in My Settings and all split-related features become accessible. Disabling Team Selling hides all team and split features across the system.

2. ### **Opportunity Teams (My Settings)**

**Path:** My Settings → Opportunity Team *(This menu item appears only after Team Selling is enabled)*

#### **2.1 Teams List**

Displays all teams created by the logged-in user, with columns for Team Name and Description. Each team supports Edit and Delete actions. Click a team name to open its detail view.

### **Opportunity Split Settings**

#### **4.2 Split Types**

All configured split types are listed with columns for Split Label, Split Field, Totals 100%, and Is Active. Each type can be toggled active or inactive. Four split types are created automatically:

![alt text](media/team_split/image-10.png)

* **Revenue** — splits the Amount field; percentages must total 100%.  
* **Overlay** — splits the Amount field; percentages do not need to total 100%.  
* **Expected Revenue** — splits the Expected Revenue field; percentages must total 100%.  
* **Expected Revenue Overlay** — splits the Expected Revenue field; no 100% requirement.  
* **Allow All Users in Splits** —Toggle **Allow All Users in Splits** to control who can be assigned a split. When off (the default), only opportunity team members can be assigned splits. When on, any active company user is eligible.

### **Opportunity Splits (Opportunity Detail View)**

When Opportunity Splits are enabled, a **Splits** section appears on the opportunity detail view with a tab for each active split type.

#### **5.1 Split Tabs**

Each active split type appears as a separate tab (e.g., Revenue, Overlay, Expected Revenue). Switch between tabs to manage splits for different split types independently.

#### **5.2 Manage Opportunity splits**

Each tab shows a table with User, Split Percentage, and Split Amount columns. Click **\+ Add Row** to add a new assignment, select a user, then enter either a Split Percentage (the amount is calculated automatically) or a Split Amount (the percentage is recalculated automatically).

*  **Totals and Validation:** The table footer shows the Total Percentage and Total Amount across all rows. Split types with Totals 100% required will be validated before saving; overlay types accept any total.

*  **Save and Recalculate:** Click **Save** to store all split rows for the active split type. If the opportunity's amount or expected revenue changes later, click **Recalculate** to update all split amounts proportionally based on saved percentages. Individual rows can be removed using the delete icon.
