# **Lead & Opportunity Stages – Functional Guide**

## **Introduction**

The **Lead Stage** and **Opportunity Stage** modules in Twixio CRM allow organizations to design and manage structured sales pipelines. Administrators can create, customize, and reorder stages to match their sales process while ensuring standardized reporting and forecasting across the company.

Both modules support:

* **Drag-and-drop stage ordering**

* **Final stage enforcement** (only one final stage allowed per company, always positioned last)

* **Stage probability management**

## **1\. Accessing Lead and Opportunity Stages**

* **Lead Stages**:  
   Navigate to **Settings → Lead → Lead Stage**

* **Opportunity Stages**:  
   Navigate to **Settings → Opportunity → Opportunity Stage**

Each section provides a list view of existing stages and the ability to add, edit, or delete stages.

## **2\. Lead Stage Management**

### **Lead Stage List View**

* **Probability (%)**

* **Actions** (Edit / Delete)

### **Creating a New Lead Stage**

* **Probability** – Enter the probability percentage.

* **Is Final Stage** – Toggle if this is the final stage.

* **Status Order** – Automatically assigned; if final, set to last.

**Business Rule**:

* If a stage is marked as **Final**, it is **automatically placed last in the order**.

* **Only one final stage is allowed per company.** Attempting to mark another stage as final will reset the previous one.
