## **Approval, Rejection, and Resubmission**

### **Approved**

When all reviewed fields are approved, the record becomes visible in the module's main list view (e.g. Leads list). The record owner is notified if Notify on Approval is enabled.

### **Rejected**

The record does not appear in the list view. The record owner is notified if Notify on Rejection is enabled. The owner can correct the data and resubmit the record for review.

### **Resubmission**

After the owner updates and resubmits the record, it re-enters the review queue with a Pending status. The approver is notified if Notify on Resubmission is enabled.

## **Expected Behavior**

* Users can create review processes and associate them with a module.  
* Entry criteria control which records enter the process; if no criteria are set, all records are included.  
* Multiple rules can be configured per process, each with its own conditions and approvers.  
* Records matching a process appear in the assigned approver's My Review Jobs queue.  
* Approvers review each configured field individually and approve or reject with an optional comment.  
* Rejected records remain hidden from the list view until resubmitted and approved.  
* A record is visible in the list view only after all required fields are approved.  
* Notifications are sent based on the toggle settings configured in the review process.
