## **3\. Best Practices**

* Configure at least one mail server before attempting to send emails from the CRM.  
* Designate one configuration as the Primary Mail Server for default email operations.  
* For Outlook configurations, ensure proper Azure AD app registration and permissions are set up beforehand.  
* For other mail servers using Gmail or similar providers, use app-specific passwords rather than regular account passwords for enhanced security.  
* Test each configuration after setup using the envelope icon to verify successful email delivery.  
* Maintain secure storage of client secrets and passwords; use the visibility toggle only when necessary.  
* Regularly review and update mail configurations to ensure continued functionality and security compliance.
