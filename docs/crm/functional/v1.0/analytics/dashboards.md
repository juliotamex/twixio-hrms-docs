### **1.7 Navigation & Folder Hierarchy**

**Purpose**: Ensure intuitive navigation through the dashboard organizational structure.

* **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Displays the current path (e.g., All Folders \> Sales \> Q1 Dashboards) for easy orientation.

**1.8 Report & Chart View Integration**

* **Add Report as Component:**   
  * From the Reports module detail view, any saved report that includes a chart can be added directly to a dashboard as a component.   
  * When adding, the chart type, grouping field, and secondary grouping are automatically mapped from the report's existing configuration — no manual reconfiguration needed.   
  * This lets users surface report-level insights directly inside a dashboard without rebuilding the chart from scratch.  
* **Add Chart View as Component:**   
  * Every CRM module (e.g., Leads, Customers, Deals) includes a Chart View — a visual chart representation of that module's data.   
  * From within that module's chart view, users can pin it to any dashboard as a persistent component.  
  * The module and grouping configuration are captured at the time of saving, so the chart continues to render live data within the dashboard context.

### **1.9 Home Page Configuration**

**Purpose**: Deliver personalized home page experiences based on user preferences.

* **Default Dashboard Home Page:** Setting a dashboard as default makes it the user's home page upon login. The dashboard renders directly within the home page view, including all components and the date range filter.

* **System Default Home Page:** If no dashboard is set as default, users see the standard system home page, which contains a dynamically generated set of KPI, chart, and table widgets based on configured CRM modules.

* **Default Home Layout Ordering:** On the system default home page, KPI widgets and charts/tables can each be independently reordered. The custom layout is saved per user and restored on subsequent visits.  
* **Reset Default Home Layout:** Users can reset the default home page layout back to the system-generated order at any time.  
* **Dynamic Home Page Loading:** The home page content updates automatically based on the user's default dashboard selection — switching the default dashboard immediately changes the home page on next login.  
* **User-Specific Configuration:** Each user independently manages their own default dashboard and home layout without affecting other users.  
* **Date Range Filtering:**  Allow users to analyze dashboard data across specific time windows.  
  * Preset Ranges: One-click filters for Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Last 60 Days, and Last 90 Days.  
  * Custom Date Range: Define a specific start and end date using a date picker.  
  * All Data: Remove date filtering to display all historical records.  
  * Dashboard-Wide Application: The selected date range applies simultaneously to all chart, table, and KPI components on the dashboard.  
  * Automatic Date Field Detection: The system automatically identifies the date field on each module's model to apply the filter correctly.
